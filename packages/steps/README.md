# Steps

[//]: # 'AUTO INSERT HEADER PREPUBLISH'

`lion-steps` breaks a single goal down into dependable sub-tasks.

## Features

- navigate between different steps with 'previous' and 'next' functions.
- keeps status of each step
  - untouched
  - entered
  - left
  - skipped
- options
  - **initial-step**: Set to the first step of the flow, blocks calling `previous` function.
  - **condition**: Dynamic condition, when true the step is added to the flow.
  - **invert-condition**: Inverts the condition set.

In many application you build multi-step workflows like multi-step forms where you want to split a long process into smaller steps making easier user's perception of it and making easier filling in data. The idea of this component is to provide a simple way to define such steps and transition from one to another while saving data between them and conditionally skip some steps based on the data.

## How to use

### Installation

```sh
npm i --save @lion/select
```

```js
import '@lion/steps/lion-steps.js';
import '@lion/steps/lion-step.js';
```

### Define steps

We provide two components: `lion-steps` and `lion-step`. Steps need to be direct children of `lion-steps`.

```html
<lion-steps id="steps">
  <lion-step initial-step>Step 1</lion-step>
  <lion-step>Step 2</lion-step>
  <lion-step>......</lion-step>
  <lion-step>Step N</lion-step>
</lion-steps>
```

The first step needs to be explicitely set via `initial-step` so that it get status `entered`, while others are `untouched` by default. You can navigate between steps using `next()` and `previous()` methods, so that next step gets `entered` status, while previous one becomes `left`:

```js
...
next() {
  return this.$id('steps').next();
}

previous() {
  return this.$id('steps').previous();
}
...
```

### Conditions

You can provide a condition to a step (with or without `invert-condition` emulating if-else flow):

```html
<lion-steps data="[[data]]">
  <lion-step>...</lion-step>
  <lion-step>step where `data.smth` is set</lion-step>
  <lion-step condition="myConditionFunc">if</lion-step>
  <lion-step condition="myConditionFunc" invert-condition>else</lion-step>
  <lion-step>...</lion-step>
</lion-steps>

<script>
  // you have `data` property defined in the scope
  ...
  myConditionFunc(data) {
    return data.smth === "what-you-need";
  }
  ...
</script>
```

If a condition was not met a step gets a status `skipped`.

### Forward only steps

If you have an intermediate step loading data via AJAX request and then automatically calling `next()`, you can flag it as `forward-only`. This will ensure that navigation to previous step is possible and does not lead to another AJAX request which leads to next step again breaking flow for a user.

```html
<lion-steps>
  <lion-step>preliminary step</lion-step>
  <lion-step forward-only>data is loaded and next() is called automatically afterwards</lion-step>
  <!-- user decides to go to previous step here -->
  <lion-step>do smth with data</lion-step>
</lion-steps>
```

### Events

If you need to be notified when transition between steps happens use `transition` event providing steps data:

```html
<lion-steps on-transition="onTransition">
  <lion-step>Step 1</lion-step>
  <lion-step>Step 2</lion-step>
  <lion-step>Step 3</lion-step>
</lion-steps>

<script>
  ...
  onTransition(event) {
    console.log(event.detail.fromStep.number); // Number
    console.log(event.detail.fromStep.element); // <lion-step>
    console.log(event.detail.toStep.number); // Number
    console.log(event.detail.toStep.element); // <lion-step>
  }
  ...
</script>
```

For notifications about specific step status change you can use individual events like this:

```html
<lion-steps>
  <lion-step on-left="onLeft">Step 1</lion-step>
  <lion-step on-skipped="onSkipped">Step 2</lion-step>
  <lion-step on-entered="onEntered">Step 3</lion-step>
</lion-steps>
```
